Our research is motivated by the desire to expand the last frontier of aerospace engineering, represented by hypersonic vehicles and high-speed VTOL aircraft. The development of these advanced aerospace systems has been constrained by their inherent complex multi-physics nature and the adverse uncertain working environment.  While there are relatively mature solutions for each single disciplinary involved in multi-physics problems, these problems cannot be completely understood and solved without integrating the multi-disciplinary tools for the modeling, testing, and robust design of future unconventional aircraft.

Perhaps the "holy grail" in the modeling of complex physical phenomena is to find **one** mathematical model that is
+ Accurate to reproduce the dynamics
  - Over a wide range of operating conditions
  - Capturing nonlinearities such as bifurcations and limit cycles
+ Computationally efficient to evaluate
  - Supports automatic differentiation for optimization
  - Allowing for real-time computation
+ Supports high-dimensional/distributed parameters
  - Geometrical shapes for optimization
  - Control inputs for 
This one model can enable the integrated optimization of an autonomous engineering system involving 

multi-disciplinary analysis as well as simultaneous considerations of control and autonomy
