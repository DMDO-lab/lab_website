On Aug. 31st, Dr. Huang gave a talk in the [IBiM seminar series](http://ibim-conference.com/) titled **"Surrogate and Reduced-Order Modeling for Fluid-Thermal-Structural Interaction (FTSI) in High-Speed Flow"**. The talk presented our recent work on multi-fidelity multi-variate Gaussian process regression and physics-infused reduced-order modeling, and their applications to the aerothermal load modeling in FTSI analysis. Our ultimate goal is to

**Develop efficient computational methodologies for dynamical systems of high-dimensional states, inputs/outputs, and design variables, that are amenable for the analysis, design, optimization, and control of practical multi-disciplinary systems.**

The recording is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKAKG5ZPKsA), and the slides are [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lPp1lh-ps9u8o3zTOjHK38yB3HjtwjTz/view?usp=sharing).

IBiM seminar series is organized by a group of mechanical and aerospace engineers, including Drs. [Dixia Fan](https://www.i4fsi.com/), [Sicheng He](https://mdolab.engin.umich.edu/staff_members/she), etc. It focuses on the fluid-structural interaction in engineering and scientific applications.
