Happened during the past three days (Oct. 26-28) is the annual workshop of the [Center for Acoustics and Vibration](www.cav.psu.edu). Particularly, there is a panel discussion on the applications of AI/ML techniques to the field of acoustics and vibration, where experts/practitioners from both academia and industry gathered and exchanged their ideas. The event was moderated by Drs. Karl Reichard and Daning Huang, with Dr. Steve Hambric as the lead organizer of the workshop.

Due to the virtual format of the workshop, a set of nice videos were pre-recorded by the panelists and moderators on their research topics. These videos are available [here](www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5LGL8sxOiJE-1yqbcokKkDlBVTBcBEtI).

Among these videos is [one from APUS Lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLtH9BrROPg&list=PL5LGL8sxOiJE-1yqbcokKkDlBVTBcBEtI&index=2&t=1108s), which covers our recent work in surrogate modeling (using Gaussian process regression) and data driven model discovery (using adjoint-based optimization plus neural networks).
