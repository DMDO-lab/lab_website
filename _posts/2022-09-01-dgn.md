Often a complex engineering system can be modeled as **a system of subsystems** that interact with each other and with the environment.  Leveraging the connectivity between the subsystems, i.e., the **topology**, can greatly reduce the efforts in the modeling, optimization, and control of such systems.
The geometric deep learning technique, esp., **graph neural networks** (GNNs), is an effective and powerful tool for the **topology-informed modeling** of complex systems, with a few unique features:
+ **Training efficiency and scalability**: The GNNs model localized interactions between the subsystems; thus can be trained on datasets of small systems and scale up to large inter-connected systems
+ **Missing data completion**: The GNNs reconstruct missing dynamical states by leveraging spatiotemporal correlations as well as time-delay embedding theorems in dynamical system theory

Recently, we have been able to apply GNNs for various applications,
from the vanilla modeling of dynamics
+ Power grid dynamics (Figure left below, [paper](arxiv.org/abs/2204.08557), [fund](/award_amps_22/))
+ Ship airwakes (Figure right below, [paper](doi.org/10.2514/6.2022-2533))
+ Heatwave forecasting (Paper to come)

to the control of inter-connected systems, such as
+ Hierarchical control of electrothermal systems ([fund](/award_icds_22/))
