Together with Dr. [Herschel Pangborn](http://www.paclab.info/) from Mechanical Engineering, we obtained a seed grant from [the ICDS of Penn State](https://www.icds.psu.edu/resources-for-researchers/icds-funding-opportunities/).  The APUS lab will contribute by developing a novel geometric deep learning (GDL) methodology for the hierarchical modeling and control of multi-physics energy systems.

Specifically, the methodology will be applied to improve the efficiency, performance, and safety of electro-thermal systems used for electrified transportation.
Based on the GDL model, a hierarchical control strategy will be developed to optimize electrified vehicle energy management by coordinating real-time decision-making across multiple domains and dynamic timescales.
If successful, the methods will introduce a paradigm shift in distributed control, from expensive and time-consuming manual iterations to an automated and efficient procedure, and thus impacting systems integration of platforms for electrified mobility (e.g., eVTOL aircraft and naval ships).
