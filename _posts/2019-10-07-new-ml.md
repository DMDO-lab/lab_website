Dr. Huang is going to offer a new graduate course, Machine Learning in Aerospace Engineering, for the semester of 2020 Spring.

This is course trimmed for applications in aerospace engineering. The course will (1) cover the machine learning techniques for the data-driven modeling and data analysis with emphasis on aerospace engineering applications, and (2) expose the students to the latest advances in the data-driven modeling studies that would be beneficial to their research.

While this is a graduate-level course, undergrads that are brave enough are welcomed to attend as well.
