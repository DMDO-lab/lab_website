This work is in collaboration with Dr. [Zhenbo Wang](http://volweb.utk.edu/~zwang124/resume.html)'s group at Univ. of Tennessee, Knoxville, and it makes a milestone in our pursuit for the integration of high-fidelity discipline models, design optimizations, and optimal controller design.

Specifically, the motivation is that recent advances in efficient optimization algorithms and high-performance computing allow
the construction of integrated design frameworks wherein the **traditionally segregated disciplines**
such as airframe design and trajectory design can be coupled together in order to undertake the
design and optimization of vehicles as **integrated systems in a larger design space**.

This paper we demonstrated the potential of this concept by incorporating high-fidelity aerodynamic models
and trajectory optimization techniques in hypersonic vehicle designs by incrementally varying
the geometric parameters of the vehicle to observe induced performance variations and optimize
these parameters for specific mission profiles using Bayesian optimization.
