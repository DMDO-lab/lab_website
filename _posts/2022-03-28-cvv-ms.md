Carlos joined the APUS lab in 2020 and has been working on the integration of physics-based and data-driven models via a novel optimal control formulation.  He has just completely his thesis: **"Physics-Infused Reduced-Order Modeling Of Aerothermal Loads for Fluid-Thermal-Structural Interactions"**, and obtained his Master's degree in Aerospace Engineering with a Minor in Mathematics.  Congratulations!

Next he will continue the journey with us as a Ph.D. student.
