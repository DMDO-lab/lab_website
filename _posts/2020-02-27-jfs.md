The most interesting finding is that

```
    Some benign structural instabilities can be exploited so as to improve the stability boundary of hypersonic vehicle structures
```

This implies a new methodology to design ultra-light long-endurance hypersonic structures.

More highlights are the following:

Aerothermoelastic response of a 3D stiffened skin panel in hypersonic flow is studied.
Near-real-time high-fidelity hypersonic aerothermoelastic simulation is achieved.
Aerothermoelastic instability is effectively identified using a linearized approach.
Snap-through does not necessarily cause the unstable response of a skin panel.
Orientations of flow and stiffeners impact the aerothermoelastic stability boundary.
