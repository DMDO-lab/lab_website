In this past December, the Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) Group of the Center for Acoustics and Vibration (CAV) held a mini-workshop where the group members gave quick overviews of their work and shared thoughts on AI/ML methods and applications. These include:

+ [Karl Reichard](https://www.acs.psu.edu/people/directory-detail-g.aspx?q=KMR5) and Jim Kozlowski – Unsupervised Learning for Diesel Engine Health Prognostics
+ [Greg Banyay](https://www.cav.psu.edu/directory-detail-g.aspx?q=gab5631) – On Mitigating the Opacity of Digital Twins
+ [Puneet Singla](https://cass.psu.edu/people/) – Data Driven Modeling and Uncertainty Quantification
+ [Kostas Papakonstantinou](https://sites.psu.edu/kpapakon/) – Computational challenges in infrastructure decision making
+ [Carlos Vargas Venegas](/team/) and Daning Huang – Physics infused reduced order modeling of hypersonic aerothermal loads for aerothermoelastic analysis
+ [Yin Yu](/team/) and Daning Huang – Graph neural network for nonlinear dynamical systems

The video recording now is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryVOaLoCSrk) on the YouTube channel of CAV.
