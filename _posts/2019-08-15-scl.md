A long-standing challenge in the aerothermoelastic analysis is **the lack of hypersonic aerothermoelastic scaling laws for aerothermoelastic testing, which precludes experimental validation of the modeling tools**. This approach is impractical due to the lack of aerothermoelastic scaling laws required for the construction of scaled models and mapping the experimental results back to the full-scale prototype. Therefore, **it is not surprising that the design of airbreathing hypersonic vehicles has encountered numerous difficulties in the past, including failures during flight as well as high-temperature structural testing**. The work conducted on hypersonic vehicles in the 1960s concluded that complete hypersonic aerothermoelastic similarity is impossible to achieve for scale ratios that differ from unity.

**We have developed a novel two-pronged approach for obtaining aerothermoelastic scaling laws, which overcomes the difficulties encountered in the earlier analytical work**. The two-pronged approach combines the classical theoretical framework with modern simulation based on computational aerothermoelasticity, as illustrated in Fig. 2. The search for an aerothermoelastically scaled model is systematically formulated as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem, which is subsequently solved using **our Python library called MOBO (Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization)**.

The methodology and tools developed for aerothermoelastic scaling can be applied to testing components of a hypersonic vehicle. Some of the flight tests on the full-size vehicle could be replaced by experiments of the scaled models, which could reduce the cost of hypersonic vehicle development by one or two orders of magnitude. Therefore, **the novel numerical scaling approach has the potential for saving considerable funds in the development cycle of a hypersonic vehicle and thus accelerates the advent of a new era of airbreathing hypersonic flight.**

For more technical details on the numerical aerothermoelastic scaling laws, as well as access to the Bayesian optimization code, please refer to our papers [SciTech2019](http://doi.org/10.2514/6.2019-1120) and [AIAAJ2020](https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059308).
