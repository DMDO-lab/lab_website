For the coming AIAA SciTech 2023 conference we are able to complete and submit two papers spanning over a range of research fields, with our collaborators. Here are the summaries:

## Aeroelastic Scaling
Design of an Aeroelastically Scaled Model in a Compressed Air Wind Tunnel Facility Using Multifidelity Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization
+ Daning Huang, [Ashwin Renganathan](https://sites.psu.edu/csdl/), [Mark A. Miller](https://fluids.psu.edu/)
+ This paper presents the design of a **geometrically nonlinear aeroelastically scaled model** in a **compressed air wind tunnel (CAWT)** facility using a two-pronged approach that integrates the classical **dimensional analysis** and a systematic **multi-disciplinary optimization** procedure.
+ This is unique combination of three research groups at Penn State - **our computational modeling** in aeroelasticity and **numerical scaling** methodology, Dr. Renganathan's **Bayesian optimization** techniques, and Dr. Miller's one-of-a-kind **CAWT facility**.
+ [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y1Unb0Q-Nxgug0pIUqDGytQFMy0uzHss/view?usp=sharing) are the 10-min slides for this paper.

## Landing of eVTOL
Optimal Landing Control of eVTOL Vehicles Using ODE-Based Aerodynamic Model
+ [Zhenbo Wang](http://volweb.utk.edu/~zwang124/resume.html), Yufei Wu, Daning Huang
+ We propose a novel approach to optimal landing control of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicles for potentially wide applications such as **urban air mobility (UAM)**, passenger transportation, package delivery, and aircraft carrier landing missions.
+ Particularly we aim to develop efficient algorithms that facilitate generation of **accurate optimal landing trajectories** for eVTOL vehicles under operational constraints considering **high-fidelity aerodynamic models**.
