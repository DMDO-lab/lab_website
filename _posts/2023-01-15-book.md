We are happy to announce that our textbook on **Structural Dynamics** is now available from [Cambridge University Press (CUP)](https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/engineering/engineering-design-kinematics-and-robotics/structural-dynamics-theory-and-applications-aerospace-and-mechanical-engineering-volume-50).

The book is based on the leading author's lecture notes of over forty years, with highlights on **rotating and time-periodic systems**, and includes the second author's unique treatment in **structural damping**, as well as Dr. Huang's contributions in **eigenvalue problems** and **time integration methods**.

The description from CUP is provided in the following:

Master the principles of structural dynamics with this comprehensive and self-contained textbook, with key theoretical concepts explained through real-world engineering applications. The theory of natural modes of vibration, the finite element method and the dynamic response of structures is balanced with practical applications to give students a thorough contextual understanding of the subject. Enhanced coverage of damping, rotating systems, and parametric excitation provides students with superior understanding of these essential topics. Examples and homework problems, closely linked to real-world applications, enrich and deepen student understanding. Curated mathematical appendices equip students with all the tools necessary to excel, without disrupting coverage of core topics. Containing all the material needed for a one- or two-semester course, and accompanied online by Matlab code, this authoritative textbook is the ideal introduction for graduate students in aerospace, mechanical and civil engineering.
