For the coming AIAA Aviation 2023 conference we will be presenting three papers spanning over a range of research fields, with our collaborators. Here are the summaries:

## Multi-timescale hierarchical control
[Graph-based Hierarchical Control of Electrified Aircraft Systems with Automated Timescale Decomposition](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2023-4509)
+ Yin Yu, Seho Park, Daning Huang, [Herschel Pangborn](http://www.paclab.info/)
+ This paper aims to address one main challenge in the **energy management of electrified aircraft** involving nonlinear electro-thermo-mechanical dynamics.  Hierarchical control is a potent method to control the system in an efficient and nearly optimal manner, yet it requires the knowledge of **multiple timescales** that are unlikely available.
+ We developed an algorithm that leverages Koopman theory for **systematic timescale decomposition** of a networked dynamical system, which informs the design of a hierarchical control framework.  The whole workflow is demonstrated on an electrified unmanned aerial vehicle.

## Modal analysis of fluid flow
[Modal Analysis of Spatiotemporal Data via Multi-fidelity Multi-variate Gaussian Processes](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2023-4350)
+ Jiwoo Song, Daning Huang
+ We identified an interesting connection between Gaussian processes (GP) and the classical dynamical mode decomposition (DMD) method via linear system theory and Koopman formalism; in some sense, both methods estimate the spectral density of the underlying system.
+ Viewing GP as a Bayesian version of DMD, we demonstrate the robustness of GP in the presence of nonlinearity, high noise, and irregular time sampling.
+ [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l32RVnxwMGxEUCsSvFT3bYTdicB4nSYu/view?usp=sharing) are the 10-min slides for this paper.

## Landing of eVTOL
[Precision Landing Trajectory Optimization for eVTOL Vehicles with High-Fidelity Aerodynamic Models](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2023-3409)
+ Yufei Wu, Sabrullah Deniz, Yang Shi, [Zhenbo Wang](http://volweb.utk.edu/~zwang124/resume.html), Daning Huang
+ We propose a novel approach to optimal landing control of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicles for potentially wide applications such as **urban air mobility (UAM)**, passenger transportation, package delivery, and aircraft carrier landing missions.
+ Particularly we aim to develop efficient algorithms that facilitate generation of **accurate optimal landing trajectories** for eVTOL vehicles under operational constraints considering **high-fidelity aerodynamic models**.
