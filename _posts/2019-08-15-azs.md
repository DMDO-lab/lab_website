Mr. Aravinth Sadagopan is an aerospace engineer from Tamil Nadu, India. The adrenaline rush associated with speed and the fascination for aerodynamically shaped objects naturally drove him towards this discipline. As the first step, Mr. Sadagopan received his B. Tech (Aerospace Engineering) in 2016 from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, India. During his sophomore year, Mr. Sadagopan got inspired by the fluid mechanics taught by Dr. V. Sivadas, which channelized his curiosity towards aerospace propulsion. During summer, he did an internship at BHEL, Hyderabad, India to learn about the basics of gas turbine engines. These crucial experiences paved his way to Penn State’s “Turbomachinery Aero-Heat Transfer Lab” directed by Dr. Cengiz Camci in 2017 as a masters’ student. For his research work on supersonic turbomachinery, Mr. Sadagopan received the ASME International Gas Turbine Institute Student Scholarship (2017-18) and the “Distinguished Masters’ Thesis Award”. Motivated by the turbomachinery design experiences, he then decided to fly faster into the hypersonic regime with Dr. Daning Huang for the doctoral degree, which will focus on elucidating the aerothermoelastic stability issues due to shock-boundary layer interaction. An avid musician and sketcher, Mr. Sadagopan aspires to couple his creative energy with the heavily structured engineering in designing futuristic aerospace systems.
