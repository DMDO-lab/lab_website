For the coming AIAA SciTech 2022 conference we are able to complete and submit five papers spanning over a range of research fields, with our collaborators. Here are the summaries:

[Joint Experimental/Computational Study of Fluid-Thermal-Structural Interaction of a Cone-Slice-Ramp in Hypersonic Flow](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/6.2022-0291)
+ Aravinth Sadagopan, Daning Huang, Adam Jirasek (USAFA), Jürgen Seidel (USAFA), Anshuman Pandey (SNL), and Katya M. Casper (SNL)
+ This is a major **collaborative effort** between the experimental group from the Sandia National Lab and the computational groups from PSU and US Air Force Academy.
+ We studied the coupling between the thermoelastic response and **shock wave/boundary layer interaction** over a cone-slice-ramp configuration in hypersonic flow, **validated the results against experimental measurements**, and revealed things not available in experiments.
+ [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aH2w8kqWS9XziIStXf2rM5eLXcDSHSPX/view?usp=sharing) are the 10-min slides for this paper.

[Physics-Infused Reduced Order Modeling of Hypersonic Aerothermal Loads for Aerothermoelastic Analysis](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/6.2022-0989)
+ Carlos Vargas Venegas, Daning Huang
+ In this study continued from last year, we extended the **physics-infused reduced-order model** for the aerothermal load prediction that admits **infinite dimensional parametric and control inputs**, which makes it very amenable for applications in **multidisciplinary optimization and optimal control** applications.
+ [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wEECceyLlYefJcs3Cr7jdwO1hWMuvk-8/view?usp=sharing) are the 10-min slides for this paper.

[Reduced-Order Modeling of Ship Airwakes with Atmospheric Turbulence Effects using Dynamic Graph Networks](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/6.2022-2533)
+ Yin Yu, Desirae Major, Daning Huang, [Sven Schmitz](https://www.rotoraero.psu.edu/)
+ This is our first paper on the application of graph neural networks to the modeling a **complex dynamical system on a graph** – network of vortex particles. This case is particularly challenging as the graph itself is evolving over time. But, the initial results look promising!
+ [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19rgWyT6Fgd69fmR5WqebP4p0_Ej4GpdL/view?usp=sharing) are the 10-min slides for this paper.

[Geometric Design of Hypersonic Vehicles for Optimal Mission Performance using Machine Learning](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/6.2022-1304)
+ Brian Coulter, [Zhenbo Wang](http://volweb.utk.edu/~zwang124/resume.html), Daning Huang
+ With our collaborators from U. of Tennessee, Knoxville, we continued the study from last year and explored the possibility of coupling the **mid-fidelity aerodynamic shape optimization** of hypersonic vehicles and the **flight trajectory optimization**. We believe this is how such advanced vehicles should be designed in the future.

[Application of the Time-Varying Koopman Operator for Bifurcation Analysis in Hypersonic Aerothermoelasticity](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/6.2022-0655)
+ Damien Guého, [Puneet Singla](https://cass.psu.edu/), Daning Huang
+ A unified and automatic framework was developed to discover governing equations underlying an unknown dynamical system from data measurements, and this technique is applied to develop thermoelastic reduced-order models in various aerothermoelastic problems.
