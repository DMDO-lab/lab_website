This paper is led by our lab member, Carlos Vargas Venegas, and based on his Master's thesis.  There are two highlights.

On the methodology side, we presented a novel **physics-infused reduced-order modeling (PIROM)** approach for efficient and accurate modeling of nonlinear dynamical systems. The PIROM consists of a physics-based analytical component that represents the known physical processes and a data-driven dynamical component that represents the unknown physical processes. Both components are **differential equations**, and hence **optimal-control-theoretic** algorithms are developed to train these models.  In the benchmark problem, high-speed aerothermal modeling of a heat-conducting and deforming structure, PIROM demonstrated superior performance than the conventional surrogate models, in terms of **accuracy, sampling efficiency, and generalizability** over a wide range of operating conditions and structural boundary conditions.

On the application side, The PIROM is applied to the aerothermal load modeling for **hypersonic aerothermoelastic (ATE)** analysis and is found to accelerate the ATE simulations by two to three orders of magnitude while maintaining an accuracy comparable to high-fidelity solutions based on computational fluid dynamics.  The PIROM-based ATE solver is further demonstrated by a parametric study on the effects of boundary conditions and rib supports on the ATE response of a compliant and heat-conducting panel structure. The results not only reveal the **dramatic snap-through behavior** with respect to spring constraints of boundary conditions but also demonstrate the potential of the PIROM to facilitate the rapid and accurate **design and optimization of multidisciplinary systems such as hypersonic structures**.

The full paper is available [here](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/1.J062214).

Figure below illustrates the superior capability of PIROM in **coupled** ATE simulation in a scenario **unseen** to all models.  TVI - physics-based differential model: Simple but not accurate; Kriging - conventional surrogate: Brutal force and limited range of applicability; PIROM - Accurate and generalizable.
