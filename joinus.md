# Graduate Students
**We are always seeking highly motivated Ph.D. and Master’s students with a passion for interdisciplinary research that is critical to future aerial vehicles.** Please check out our projects page to gain an understanding of the research projects in the lab. To be successful in our lab, you are expected to be creative, diligent, open to new ideas, and passionate about your research problem. Typically, you should be good at at least two of the following three subjects: **Mathematics, Mechanics, and Computer Programming**. You are expected to have or gain the **grit** to grind through the many challenges a researcher would face.

Several things to note if you plan to apply to [the Ph.D. program in Aerospace Engineering](https://www.aero.psu.edu/academics/graduate/degrees-and-requirements.aspx#phd) at the Penn State:

+ You are encouraged to plan ahead and contact us first before applying to the Ph.D. program.
+ You need to get admitted to [the Master’s program](https://www.aero.psu.edu/academics/graduate/degrees-and-requirements.aspx#ms) first if you do not have a Master’s degree.
+ Typically, your expenses of the first year, including tuition and stipend, will be covered.

# Undergraduate Students
**We are also seeking highly motivated undergraduate students who seek to gain research experience.** As part of the lab, you are expected to get hands dirty with research problems: review literature, contribute to new ideas, learn, implement and apply computational tools, generate and analyze data. Exceptional students may have the opportunity to develop and **present at conferences**, and/or write **Honors theses**. Undergraduate research assistants may also receive course credit for their effort (AERO 496 or possible equivalent for their home departments).

## How to join
If you are interested in joining the lab, please start by contacting [Dr. Daning Huang](mailto:daning@psu.edu) via a short email containing:

+ Your complete educational background
+ Your unofficial transcripts
+ Your relevant research/academic/industrial experiences
+ A 300-word statement on your research interest in the lab ([here](research) is a good place to start)
