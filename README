We use a static push method.  The static website is built locally and the `_site` folder is pushed to `gh-pages` branch.

Hence the minimal steps to update are:
+ Build updated website by
```
jekyll build
```
+ To check the website locally,
```
jekyll serve
```
+ cd to `_site` and push the changes
```
git add -A
git commit -m "message"
git push
```
